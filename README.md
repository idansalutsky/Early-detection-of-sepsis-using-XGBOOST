# Early-detection-of-sepsis-using-XGBOOST

Sepsis is a life-threatening medical condition caused by an immune response to a serious infection. Every year about 1.7 million people in the US develop sepsis and of these about 270,000 die. Therefore early prediction of sepsis and starting medical treatment accordingly are critical.

The data were collected from intensive care patients at two US hospitals.
In this work, the prediction was made about 6 hours before he was identified as suffering from sepsis. The algorithm I used is XGBOOST, the results of the model are F1=73% on the test set.

In the attached report I explained the background, the investigation of the variables, dealing with missing information, Feature Engineering, Features transformations, the results of various algorithms and the analysis of the XGBOOST results.
